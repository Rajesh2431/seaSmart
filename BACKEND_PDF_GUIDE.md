# Backend PDF Reference System

## Overview
The SeaSmart app now uses a backend PDF reference system where the AI has access to pre-loaded mental health resources instead of requiring users to upload PDFs.

## How It Works

### 1. **Backend PDF Service** (`lib/services/backend_pdf_service.dart`)
Contains comprehensive mental health resources:

- **Mental Health Guide**: Depression, anxiety, stress management, crisis resources
- **Breathing Techniques**: 4-7-8 breathing, box breathing, diaphragmatic breathing
- **Journaling Guide**: Therapeutic journaling, prompts, different techniques

### 2. **Smart Context Detection**
The AI automatically includes relevant PDF content based on user questions:

```dart
// User asks about anxiety → Mental Health Guide + Breathing Techniques
// User asks about journaling → Journaling Guide  
// User asks about breathing → Breathing Techniques
// General questions → Mental Health Guide (default)
```

### 3. **Enhanced AI Responses**
The AI can now provide:
- Evidence-based mental health information
- Specific breathing exercise instructions
- Detailed journaling techniques
- Crisis management guidance
- Professional resource recommendations

## Example User Interactions

### Depression/Anxiety Questions:
**User**: "I'm feeling really anxious lately"
**AI Response**: References mental health guide and breathing techniques, provides specific 4-7-8 breathing instructions

### Breathing/Relaxation:
**User**: "Can you teach me a breathing exercise?"
**AI Response**: Provides detailed instructions from breathing techniques guide (box breathing, 4-7-8, etc.)

### Journaling:
**User**: "How can journaling help with my mood?"
**AI Response**: References journaling guide, explains therapeutic benefits, provides specific prompts

### General Mental Health:
**User**: "I'm struggling with self-doubt"
**AI Response**: Uses mental health guide to provide comprehensive support and coping strategies

## Technical Implementation

### API Service Enhancement:

```
