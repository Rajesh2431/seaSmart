# AI Action Buttons Feature

## ✅ **What's Implemented:**

### **Precise Action Detection**
Action buttons appear **only when AI specifically suggests activities**, not for general mentions:

- **Breathing suggestions** → "Try Breathing Exercise" button
- **Journaling suggestions** → "Open Journal" button  
- **Relaxation suggestions** → "Play Calm Game" button
- **Mood tracking suggestions** → "Track Mood" button

### **Smart Button Display**
- Buttons appear **only when AI gives specific instructions** or suggestions
- **No random buttons** - only when truly relevant
- **Precise detection** - looks for action phrases, not just keywords

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

1. **User asks question** about anxiety, stress, etc.
2. **AI responds** with helpful advice
3. **System detects keywords** in AI response (breath, journal, relax, etc.)
4. **Action buttons appear** below AI message
5. **User taps button** → Navigates directly to relevant screen

## 💬 **Example Interactions:**

### **✅ SHOWS Button (Specific Suggestion):**
**User**: "I'm feeling anxious"
**AI**: "Try a breathing exercise - inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4."
**Button**: [🫁 Try Breathing Exercise] ← Shows because AI said "try a breathing exercise"

### **❌ NO Button (General Mention):**
**User**: "I'm feeling anxious"
**AI**: "I understand you're feeling anxious. Take your time to process this."
**Button**: None ← No button because AI didn't suggest a specific action

### **✅ SHOWS Button (Journaling Suggestion):**
**User**: "I can't organize my thoughts"
**AI**: "Try writing down your thoughts in a journal to help clarify them."
**Button**: [📖 Open Journal] ← Shows because AI said "try writing down"

### **❌ NO Button (General Support):**
**User**: "I'm confused"
**AI**: "It's normal to feel confused sometimes. You're not alone in this."
**Button**: None ← No button because no specific activity suggested

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Precise Action Phrase Detection:**
```dart
// Breathing: "try breathing", "breathing exercise", "inhale for", "deep breath"
// Journaling: "try journaling", "write down your", "keep a journal"
// Relaxation: "try a game", "calming activity", "do something calming"
// Mood: "track your mood", "monitor your mood", "record your feelings"
```

### **What Changed:**
- **Before**: Detected any mention of "breath", "feeling", "calm" → Too many buttons
- **Now**: Only detects specific action suggestions → Buttons only when relevant

### **Button Actions:**
- **Breathing** → `BreathingScreen()`
- **Journal** → `JournalScreen()`
- **Calm Game** → `GridCalmGame()`
- **Mood Tracking** → `JournalScreen()` (mood section)
